# Project 1
## General Info
Computer/CPU info can be found in the README at the root of this repository

## Usage
The default `make` target will create a build of each source file. `make clean`
can be run to delete all intermediate and output files generated by `make`.

The `generate____Csv.sh` scripts will run the various programs ten times and
output the results to a CSV file. From there, `generateCharts.R` will read in
all the CSV data, print any required tables, and create a pdf called
`Rplots.pdf` containing any graphs.

To turn the PDF into a series of images I could embed in this markdown file, I
ran:
```
cpdf Rplots.pdf -gs gs -output-image -o images/chart%%.png
```
Of course, the ability to run some of these commands on your machine depends on
having the proper packages installed on your system, namely the 'R' language
(and some R libraries) and 'cpdf'/'gs' for pdf->png conversion.

## Choices
For this, we had to choose between a hash table, binary search tree (BST), or a
simplified B+ tree. I went with a BST.
