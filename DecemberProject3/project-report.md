# Project 1
## General Info
Computer/CPU info can be found in the README at the root of this repository

## Usage
The default `make` target will create a build of each source file. `make clean`
can be run to delete all intermediate and output files generated by `make`.

The `generateCsv.sh` script will run the various programs under each
configuration ten times and output the results to a CSV file. From there,
`generateCharts.R` will read in all the CSV data, print any required tables, and
create a pdf called `Rplots.pdf` containing any graphs.

To turn the PDF into a series of images I could embed in this markdown file, I
ran:
```
cpdf Rplots.pdf -gs gs -output-image -o images/chart%%.png
```
Of course, the ability to run some of these commands on your machine depends on
having the proper packages installed on your system, namely the 'R' language
(and some R libraries) and 'cpdf'/'gs' for pdf->png conversion.

## Choices & Process
For the hashing, I have gone with Murmur3 (one of the hashing options listed in
the document). There is a set seed that all of the filters use for their
hashing, so the results of the program should be identical on each run.

So far, I have implemented a basic hashset (not strictly necessary), a
blocked bloom filter, and an XOR filter.
