# Project 1
## General Info
Computer/CPU info can be found in the README at the root of this repository

## Usage
The default `make` target will create a baseline and vectorized build of each
source file, as well as assembly outputs (in `src/asm-*/`) and vectorization
reports (in `src/obj-*/` with the `.o` files). `make clean` can be run to delete
all intermediate and output files generated by `make`.

The `generate-csvs.sh` script will run all of the compiled programs and make
CSV files with the relevant data from each experiment. From there,
`generate-charts.R` will create a pdf called `Rplots.pdf` containing graphs of
the CSV data.

To turn the PDF into a series of images I could embed in this markdown file, I
ran:
```
cpdf Rplots.pdf -gs gs -output-image -o images/chart%%.png
```
Of course, the ability to run some of these commands on your machine depends on
having the proper packages installed on your system, namely the 'R' language
(and some R libraries) and 'cpdf'/'gs' for pdf->png conversion.

## Features
For this, we were required to chose four features to experiment with. I have
chosen the following features:
1) Zero-copy I/O
2) Async I/O
3) Scheduler control groups
4) Transparent huge pages

## Test 1: Zero-copy I/O
